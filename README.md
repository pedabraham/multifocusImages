# Multifocus images

A multi-focus image is an image composed of multiple images with different areas of focus. 

In this set for every image A there is an image B, which both belong to the same scene but each one has a different area of focus.

You can see a use of case for this images in my article [Multi-focus Image fusion using interpolations](http://www.jovenesenlaciencia.ugto.mx/index.php/jovenesenlaciencia/article/view/2826/2080)
